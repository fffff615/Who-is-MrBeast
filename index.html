         <h1>His Childhood</h1>
        <p>MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson,
             was <strong>born on May 7, 1998, in Kansas,
                 USA

             </strong>
            , and grew up in Greenville, 
            North Carolina. From a young age, he
             was interested in video games and 
             YouTube, often watching popular creators.
              He attended Greenville Christian Academy
               but struggled with traditional schooling,
                preferring to focus on his passion for
                 making videos.

            As a teenager, Jimmy 
            started his YouTube channel in
             2012, posting gaming content and experiments to
              understand YouTube’s algorithm.
               He gained attention in 2017
                when he uploaded a video counting to 
                <strong>100,000</strong>, which went viral. 
                This marked the beginning of his unique
                 challenge and philanthropy-focused 
                 content.
            
            Despite his early struggles,
             Jimmy’s persistence and 
             creativity helped him become
              one of the biggest YouTubers,
               known for giving away <strong>milions</strong> 
               of dollars and making high-production 
               challenge videos.</p>
